                    <p>
                        Edmund Husserl developed a systematic philosophy of consciousness--"phenomenology"--at the turn
                        of the 20th century. I have written or edited several books on Husserl, including the open
                        access book, <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-26074-2">Horizons of
                        Phenomenology</a>, which features an article containing a <a
                            href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-26074-2_2/figures/2">bibliometric
                        visualization</a> of the entire phenomenology literature. My earlier book, <a
                            href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-26698-5">Husserlian Phenomenology: A
                        Unifying Interpretation</a>, formalizes certain key features of Husserl's work. I also created
                        and maintain a site, <a href="http://www.husserl.net/">Husserl.net</a>, which features a variety
                        of interactive tools for Husserl scholars.

                        From mapping arguments to visualizing neural networks to making cartoons and graphics to teach
                        phenomenology, I have always been oriented towards graphical display of complex information. In
                        my recent book <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262550727/gaming-cancer/">Gaming Cancer</a>
                        I have begun to explore how gamelike visualization can facilitate scientific discovery and
                        promote other social goods like scientific literacy.

                        To study the behavior of neural networks (simulated brain circuits) in virtual environments, I
                        created a computer program called <a href="http://www.simbrain.net">Simbrain</a>, which is
                        open-source, visually-oriented, and free. I also routinely update an open-access and
                        collaboratively written book about neural networks that is based on teaching with Simbrain, <a

                    <p>
                        Dynamical systems theory is the mathematical study of how systems change in time, not just in
                        terms of how they actually behave but also in terms of how they might possibly behave. I have a
                        long-time collaboration with <a href="http://scotton.freeshell.org/">Scott Hotton</a> in this
                        area. Our primary contribution has been to formally define the concept of an open dynamical
                        system and to use this concept to study a range of natural and artificial systems. We recently
                        published a book-length study of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle">Braitenberg
                        vehicles</a> using this framework, the <a
                            href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262548199/the-open-dynamics-of-braitenberg-vehicles/">Open
                        Dynamics of Braitenberg Vehicles</a>. I have used this perspective to argue that
                        representational and embodied approaches to cognitive science are compatible with each other,
                        insofar as an open dynamical system can model the rich interactions between an agent and its
                        environment (including other agents), but also shed light on an agent's internal
                        representational dynamics.

                    <p>
                        In the 1990s I helped create a set of "debate maps" that are available <a
                            href="http://debategraph.org/Stream.aspx?nid=75&amp;iv=05">here</a>. Since then
                        debate-mapping research has been steadily advancing, and I continue to believe it's an important
                        approach to navigating complex issues using graphical tools.
